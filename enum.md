```rust
enum IpAddrKind {
    V4,
    V6,
}
```

`IpAddrKind` is now a custom data type that we can use elsewhere in our code.

We can create instances of each of the two variants of `IpAddrKind` like this:

```rust
    let four = IpAddrKind::V4;
    let six = IpAddrKind::V6;
```

How to use them:

```rust
    enum IpAddr {
        V4(u8, u8, u8, u8),
        V6(String),
    }

    let home = IpAddr::V4(127, 0, 0, 1);

    let loopback = IpAddr::V6(String::from("::1"));
```



```rust
struct Ipv4Addr {
    // --snip--
}

struct Ipv6Addr {
    // --snip--
}

enum IpAddr {
    V4(Ipv4Addr),
    V6(Ipv6Addr),
}
```

This code illustrates that you can put any kind of data inside an enum variant: strings, numeric types, or structs, for example. You can even include another enum!

Comparison between enum and struct:

```rust
enum Message {
    Quit,
    Move { x: i32, y: i32 },
    Write(String),
    ChangeColor(i32, i32, i32),
}
```

```rust
struct QuitMessage; // unit struct
struct MoveMessage {
    x: i32,
    y: i32,
}
struct WriteMessage(String); // tuple struct
struct ChangeColorMessage(i32, i32, i32); // tuple struct
```

Both are the same, but implementing/using types with enum is much more convenient here.

One enum that comes with the std library and is also included in the prelude is Options

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    None,
    Some(T),
}
```

This let us define a Null type but to actually use T we have to remove it from options, hence we can define a null value and also avoid null refrencing.

```rust
   let x: i8 = 5;
    let y: Option<i8> = Some(5);

    let sum = x + y;
```

If we run this code, we get an error message like this one:

```console
$ cargo run

  = help: the trait `Add<Option<i8>>` is not implemented for `i8`
  = help: the following other types implement trait `Add<Rhs>`:

            `&i8` implements `Add`

            `i8` implements `Add`

error: could not compile `enums` (bin "enums") due to 1 previous error
```

In effect, this error message means that Rust doesn’t understand how to add an `i8` and an `Option<i8>`, because they’re different types. When we have a value of a type like `i8` in Rust, the compiler will ensure that we always have a valid value. We can proceed confidently without having to check for null before using that value. Only when we have an `Option<i8>` (or whatever type of value we’re working with) do we have to worry about possibly not having a value, and the compiler will make sure we handle that case before using the value.

In other words, you have to convert an `Option<T>` to a `T` before you can perform `T` operations with it. Generally, this helps catch one of the most common issues with null: assuming that something isn’t null when it actually is.

How to do that?
```rust
let x: i8 = 5;
let y: Option<i8> = Some(5); // could also be None

let sum = x + y.unwrap_or(0);   // if y is None, use 0
println!("{}", sum); // 10
```


The `match` expression is a control flow construct that does just this when used with enums: it will run different code depending on which variant of the enum it has, and that code can use the data inside the matching value.


This is a valid match case to handle the rest of the expression/arms since matches are exhaustive:

```rust
    let dice_roll = 9;
    match dice_roll {
        3 => add_fancy_hat(),
        7 => remove_fancy_hat(),
        other => move_player(other),
    }

    fn add_fancy_hat() {}
    fn remove_fancy_hat() {}
    fn move_player(num_spaces: u8) {}
```

Also, we can use _  if values are not necessary. Remember to put them in the last line of the match!


We can use option in return when we sometime also want to return a None value

```rust
fn describe_state_quarter(coin: Coin) -> Option<String> {
    if let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin {
        if state.existed_in(1900) {
            Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America!"))
        } else {
            Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new."))
        }
    } else {
        None
    }
}
```

The `let...else` syntax takes a pattern on the left side and an expression on the right, very similar to `if let`, but it does not have an `if` branch, only an `else` branch. If the pattern matches, it will bind the value from the pattern in the outer scope. If the pattern does _not_ match, the program will flow into the `else` arm, which must return from the function.

```rust
fn describe_state_quarter(coin: Coin) -> Option<String> {
    let Coin::Quarter(state) = coin else {
        return None;
    };

    if state.existed_in(1900) {
        Some(format!("{state:?} is pretty old, for America!"))
    } else {
        Some(format!("{state:?} is relatively new."))
    }
}
```
