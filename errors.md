```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file_result = File::open("hello.txt");
}
```

The return type of `File::open` is a `Result<T, E>`. The generic parameter `T` has been filled in by the implementation of `File::open` with the type of the success value, `std::fs::File`, which is a file handle.


In the context of Listing 9-7, the `?` at the end of the `File::open` call will return the value inside an `Ok` to the variable `username_file`. If an error occurs, the `?` operator will return early out of the whole function and give any `Err` value to the calling code. The same thing applies to the `?` at the end of the `read_to_string` call.


```rust
use std::fs::File;
use std::io::{self, Read};

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    let mut username = String::new();

    File::open("hello.txt")?.read_to_string(&mut username)?;

    Ok(username)
}
```


Reading a file into a string is a fairly common operation, so the standard library provides the convenient `fs::read_to_string` function that opens the file, creates a new `String`, reads the contents of the file, puts the contents into that `String`, and returns it. Of course, using `fs::read_to_string` doesn’t give us the opportunity to explain all the error handling, so we did it the longer way first.

```rust
use std::fs;
use std::io;

fn read_username_from_file() -> Result<String, io::Error> {
    fs::read_to_string("hello.txt")
}
```


The `?` operator can only be used in functions whose return type is compatible with the value the `?` is used on.

```rust
use std::fs::File;

fn main() {
    let greeting_file = File::open("hello.txt")?;
}
```


```console
$ cargo run

The behavior of the `?` operator when called on an `Option<T>` is similar to its behavior when called on a `Result<T, E>`: if the value is `None`, the `None` will be returned early from the function at that point. If the value is `Some`, the value inside the `Some` is the resultant value of the expression, and the function continues. Listing 9-11 has an example of a function that finds the last character of the first line in the given text.

```rust
fn last_char_of_first_line(text: &str) -> Option<char> {
    text.lines().next()?.chars().last()
}
```
