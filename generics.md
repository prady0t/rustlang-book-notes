```rust
fn main() {
    let number_list = vec![34, 50, 25, 100, 65];

    let mut largest = &number_list[0];

    for number in &number_list {
        if number > largest {
            largest = number;
        }
    }

    println!("The largest number is {largest}");
}

```


if number > largest: 

Dereferencing happens automatically because the comparison traits are implemented so that the compiler dereferences references during comparisons.

```rust
fn largest<T>(list: &[T]) -> &T {
```

We read this definition as: the function `largest` is generic over some type `T`. It takes one parameter, `list`, which is a slice of values of type `T`. The `largest` function will return a reference to a value of the same type `T`


### In Struct Definitions

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

fn main() {
    let integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
}
```

or

```rust
struct Point<T, U> {
    x: T,
    y: U,
}

fn main() {
    let both_integer = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };
    let both_float = Point { x: 1.0, y: 4.0 };
    let integer_and_float = Point { x: 5, y: 4.0 };
}
```

### In Enum Definitions

```rust
enum Option<T> {
    Some(T),
    None,
}
```

```rust
enum Result<T, E> {
    Ok(T),
    Err(E),
}
```


### In function

```rust
struct Point<T> {
    x: T,
    y: T,
}

impl<T> Point<T> {
    fn x(&self) -> &T {
        &self.x
    }
}

fn main() {
    let p = Point { x: 5, y: 10 };

    println!("p.x = {}", p.x());
}
```

We can also specify constraints on generic types when defining methods on the type. We could, for example, implement methods only on `Point<f32>` instances rather than on `Point<T>` instances with any generic type. In Listing 10-10 we use the concrete type `f32`, meaning we don’t declare any types after `impl`.

Filename: src/main.rs

```rust
impl Point<f32> {
    fn distance_from_origin(&self) -> f32 {
        (self.x.powi(2) + self.y.powi(2)).sqrt()
    }
}
```

You might be wondering whether there is a runtime cost when using generic type parameters. The good news is that using generic types won’t make your program run any slower than it would with concrete types.

Rust accomplishes this by performing monomorphization of the code using generics at compile time. _Monomorphization_ is the process of turning generic code into specific code by filling in the concrete types that are used when compiled.
