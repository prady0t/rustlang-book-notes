Mutable references have one big restriction: if you have a mutable reference to a value, you can have no other references to that value. This code that attempts to create two mutable references to `s` will fail:

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &mut s;
    let r2 = &mut s;

    println!("{r1}, {r2}");
```
Gives error!

As always, we can use curly brackets to create a new scope, allowing for multiple mutable references, just not _simultaneous_ ones:

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    {
        let r1 = &mut s;
    } // r1 goes out of scope here, so we can make a new reference with no problems.

    let r2 = &mut s;
```

Rust enforces a similar rule for combining mutable and immutable references. This code results in an error:

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    let r3 = &mut s; // BIG PROBLEM

    println!("{r1}, {r2}, and {r3}");
```

```console

Note that a reference’s scope starts from where it is introduced and continues through the last time that reference is used. For instance, this code will compile because the last usage of the immutable references is in the `println!`, before the mutable reference is introduced:

```rust
    let mut s = String::from("hello");

    let r1 = &s; // no problem
    let r2 = &s; // no problem
    println!("{r1} and {r2}");
    // Variables r1 and r2 will not be used after this point.

    let r3 = &mut s; // no problem
    println!("{r3}");
```


```rust
fn no_dangle() -> String {
    let s = String::from("hello");

    s
}
```

Would move s out of this scope, no error.
